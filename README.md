# chess_clojure

eboard seems to work well on Linux!

Using chess_clojure with chess graphical user interfaces:

Create an executable with

lein uberjar

I created a shell script called rothfield_chess.sh with the folowing contents and set it as
executable and placed it in /usr/games
Important: Put the executable in /usr/games and the chess programs seem to be able to find them!


java -jar /home/john/chess_clojure/target/chess_clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

Then in the various chess programs that support xboard, point them to the script. 

Notes on chess gui's:
--------------------

eboard: Worked. A permissive engine.
knights: Crashes often. Too bad because it supports computer vs computer
xboard: Works. Seemed to crash on stalemate. 
scid: No
pychess: Works.
vi /home/john/.config/pychess/engines.xml
dreamchess: Works OK.
glchess: Works. Simple and fast! Easy GUI. No console window.
***** My recommendation: Use eboard on Linux or knights if it doesn't crash
