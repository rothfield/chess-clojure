(comment
  "Each location of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate pairâ€”a letter and a number. The vertical column of squares (called files) from White's left (the queenside) to his right (the kingside) are labeled a through h. The horizontal rows of squares (called ranks) are numbered 1 to 8 starting from White's side of the board. Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. (For example, White's king starts the game on square e1; Black's knight on b8 can move to open squares a6 or c6.)")

;; From wikipedia:
;; A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:
;; Piece placement (from white's perspective). Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "h". Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names (pawn = :P, knight = :N, bishop = :B, rook = :r, queen = :Q and king = :K).[1] White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.
;; Active color. "w" means White moves next, :b means Black.
;; Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: :K (White can castle kingside), :Q (White can castle queenside), :k (Black can castle kingside), and/or :q (Black can castle queenside).
;; En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[2]
;; Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
;; Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
;; Example:
;; rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
;; w means white to move- "side to move"
;; The KQkq indicates all 4 castles are elegible.
