;; location is a pair of numbers. [0 0] to [7 7]
;; board is a map of locations to pieces {[0 0] "R" [1 0] "N" }
;; [0 0] is white's queen rook
;; moves are pairs of locations  [[0 0] [0 1]]

;;   It is a capture if there is an enemy piece at the second location

;; For a given board position generate all (legal) moves
;; Then create an evaluation function and create a chess engine

(comment
  "Each location of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate pairâ€”a letter and a number. The vertical column of squares (called files) from White's left (the queenside) to his right (the kingside) are labeled a through h. The horizontal rows of squares (called ranks) are numbered 1 to 8 starting from White's side of the board. Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. (For example, White's king starts the game on square e1; Black's knight on b8 can move to open squares a6 or c6.)")
